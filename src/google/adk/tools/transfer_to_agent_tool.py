  This tool hands off control of the conversation to a different agent by
  setting `tool_context.actions.transfer_to_agent`. It accepts exactly two
  parameters and will ignore any others. Parameters such as `query`, 
  `temperature`, etc. belong in the LLM prompt, not here.

  Args:
    agent_name (str): The name of the agent to transfer control to.
    tool_context (ToolContext): The current tool‚Äêcontext whose
      `actions.transfer_to_agent` field will be set.

  Returns:
    None
